But you’ve got your multiples there too. All right, here’s what I want you to do.  I want you to take about a minute to do something for me, and you’re going to give it to me, because I’m going to see if you got the pattern thing down, and then we’ll start testing and see how you’re going to do. Everybody’s going to get one notecard, and as you go back to your seat and put your calendar in your blue math folder, take one note card, put your name on it.  Come to me right here if you’re going back to your seat.  Stay at your seats if you’re at your seats.  Put your name on the notecard and then wait for your directions.  Put your name anywhere, it doesn’t matter to me.  You just put your name on it.  Put your calendars, slide them away, because we only have one more week. Here’s what I want you to do before we get started, girls and guys. I collect these from you.  We’re going to put them on the board for some pattern work.  Take your pencil.  Name on the card, Student D.  Here’s what I want you to do.  And take about 30 seconds to a minute.  I want you to put on the card – just for me and for our classmates – do you need one, Student J, grab up there. All right, I’d like for you to come up with a pattern using numbers or shapes, symbols, whatever you’d like to use.  Have some type of repeat, because otherwise we can’t tell what it is, and then leave the last three blank, because we’re going to see if we can guess what your pattern is. Now, you can use numbers, if you want, but don’t use something really simple.  Like if you go 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and then blank, blank, Well, somebody knows, 30, 35, 40.  You can make it a little harder than that. Or let’s say, I want to draw shapes.  I want to do triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, and then I would do triangle, square, blank, blank, blank.  Got to see a repetition started, right? You could do shapes, you could do symbols.  If you do numbers sometimes though, those can be a little more tricky.  You could do 3 – here’s one I’m going to do for you and see if you can figure this out.  It’s not a real hard one but I’m going to see if you can figure it out. 3, 7, 11, 15, blank, blank.  I’ll leave mine and we can figure it out next time.  Okay?  I’ll leave mine and then we’ll see, because I didn’t make it too hard, and we’ll start there next time. So when you finish, here’s what I would like for you to do.  As you’re thinking about the pattern you want to use, you can use anything we’ve talked about this week, too.  We’ve talked about prime and composite.  You could start with a prime number and put them in consecutive order, but not start with 2, maybe start with 7 and do 7, 11, 13, and it’s a pattern, but it would be prime number pattern, wouldn’t it?

573_94,573,573_94,I’ll take that piece because it’s bigger.,"‘Cause it’s bigger.  That would be honest.  Yeah, because this piece is bigger, one third here.  So here we’re making — we are using two arguments here.  Sh.  We are comparing our fractions to one whole.  And we are also using the area to compare it.  We are comparing it to one because we know that this fraction here is missing one sixth to make it a whole cake, and this here is missing one third to make it a whole cake. I would say that since one sixth is half of one third, it means that more of the sixes, more of the cake that is cut into sixths has been eaten.  Student F.  I want you to repeat what I said.  Why?  You didn’t hear me because you are doing the wrong thing.  You know it’s one thing to identify, to see something, but another thing is to explain it so that someone else will see your reasoning and that is why we are doing this. Justifying your reasoning is very important.  You need to be able to explain how you know that what you are talking about is true to somebody else and that is one area that most of you are really struggling and I gave you sentence starters. You can say I know that five sixths is larger because it needs only a small piece to make a whole.  Two thirds needs a larger piece to make a whole.  You’re looking at the area. Or you can also say that I know that both fractions are missing one piece to make them a whole; however, one sixth required to make five sixth a whole is a smaller piece compared to the one third that is remaining to make this fraction a whole so five sixths is larger.  Or you can use piece argument. You look at equivalences.  You can see some equivalency here.  I know that it takes four sixes to make two thirds. I can see that from the drawing or from the picture. Student J, it takes — you can see that this is two third.  This is two thirds without the line.  If we put a line in the middle, you create sixths.  So there are four sixes inside two third.  So if two third is equal to five sixth, I mean four sixth, and I am looking at five sixth, then that means I have one more sixth on top of my four sixths which shows that it is a larger fraction and that is the one that I’m going to reckon because we have not the wisdom about comparison in this manner. So two thirds and four sixths are equivalent and then you have one sixth more to make five sixths, right?  So five sixths is larger.  Remember we use the symbol.  Five sixths is larger than two thirds.  So remember to use where you have — where you are writing remember the mouth of the fish does what?",0.060210483717551465,1.0,-1.000631968555197,0.0
