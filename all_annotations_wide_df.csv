2987_229,2987,2987_229,I think unlikely because this year in January it didn’t snow.,"That was this year.  This year was a weird year, by the way, and you’re absolutely right that this year in January I don’t think we had a lot of snow.  I don’t remember it snowing in January this year.  And you’re absolutely right. But that was a strange year.  This year it’s been really warm. I would say – I would say – I can understand why you put maybe, so if you put maybe, okay.  I’d say likely because I remember it snowing in January usually at least one time.  It didn’t mean that it was a snowstorm, but we could see a little bit of snow in January.  So I would have probably put likely. But if you put maybe and you’re thinking like Student B or Teacher G, like, oh, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t, then that’s where you would have put maybe.  I’m still leaning towards likely.  You know why I’m thinking that?  Because I’m a skier, and I am always paying attention to when that snow’s coming.  And I remember January being a month when usually I’m waiting for one snow.  Come on, it’s going to snow one time.  And it snows one time, at least one time.

I want you to put on the card – just for me and for our classmates – do you need one, Student J, grab up there. All right, I’d like for you to come up with a pattern using numbers or shapes, symbols, whatever you’d like to use.  Have some type of repeat, because otherwise we can’t tell what it is, and then leave the last three blank, because we’re going to see if we can guess what your pattern is. Now, you can use numbers, if you want, but don’t use something really simple.  Like if you go 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and then blank, blank, Well, somebody knows, 30, 35, 40.

Got to see a repetition started, right? You could do shapes, you could do symbols.  If you do numbers sometimes though, those can be a little more tricky.

I’ll leave mine and we can figure it out next time.  Okay?  I’ll leave mine and then we’ll see, because I didn’t make it too hard, and we’ll start there next time. So when you finish, here’s what I would like for you to do.  As you’re thinking about the pattern you want to use, you can use anything we’ve talked about this week, too.

And then for this one, we did the same thing because they’re both quadrilateral and then we decided to go for a harder shape. So we used a regular hexagon and from this top vertices we did there — we sliced and we made a triangle here, here, and here.  And there was four triangles so then we multiplied four times each of these and got 720 degrees. And the strategy was for any regular polygon besides the triangle, draw a line from one vertices to other vertices without the lines crisscrossing or intersecting.  Then multiply the angle of triangles made inside the shape and multiply it by 180.",What they say work all the time?,3,1,0.0,2,1,0.5773502691896258,1,,0.7071067811865476,1,,0.7071067811865476,1.0,0.6666666666666666,1.5,1.5,0.6666666666666666,0.5,1.0,0.4565931838004253,-0.4240095866802589,0.17113725615624897,0.7700753992901652,-0.2900245537092765,0.23519693551297716,0.3448170355768259

573_94,573,573_94,I’ll take that piece because it’s bigger.,"‘Cause it’s bigger.  That would be honest.  Yeah, because this piece is bigger, one third here.  So here we’re making — we are using two arguments here.  Sh.  We are comparing our fractions to one whole.  And we are also using the area to compare it.  We are comparing it to one because we know that this fraction here is missing one sixth to make it a whole cake, and this here is missing one third to make it a whole cake. I would say that since one sixth is half of one third, it means that more of the sixes, more of the cake that is cut into sixths has been eaten.  Student F.  I want you to repeat what I said.  Why?  You didn’t hear me because you are doing the wrong thing.  You know it’s one thing to identify, to see something, but another thing is to explain it so that someone else will see your reasoning and that is why we are doing this. Justifying your reasoning is very important.  You need to be able to explain how you know that what you are talking about is true to somebody else and that is one area that most of you are really struggling and I gave you sentence starters. You can say I know that five sixths is larger because it needs only a small piece to make a whole.  Two thirds needs a larger piece to make a whole.  You’re looking at the area. Or you can also say that I know that both fractions are missing one piece to make them a whole; however, one sixth required to make five sixth a whole is a smaller piece compared to the one third that is remaining to make this fraction a whole so five sixths is larger.  Or you can use piece argument. You look at equivalences.  You can see some equivalency here.  I know that it takes four sixes to make two thirds. I can see that from the drawing or from the picture. Student J, it takes — you can see that this is two third.  This is two thirds without the line.  If we put a line in the middle, you create sixths.  So there are four sixes inside two third.  So if two third is equal to five sixth, I mean four sixth, and I am looking at five sixth, then that means I have one more sixth on top of my four sixths which shows that it is a larger fraction and that is the one that I’m going to reckon because we have not the wisdom about comparison in this manner. So two thirds and four sixths are equivalent and then you have one sixth more to make five sixths, right?  So five sixths is larger.  Remember we use the symbol.  Five sixths is larger than two thirds.  So remember to use where you have — where you are writing remember the mouth of the fish does what?",5,1,0.0,5,1,0.0,4,2.0,0.4472135954999579,4,1.0,0.4472135954999579,1.0,1.0,1.8,0.8,1.0,0.0,0.8,0.4531655071216276,0.4298950544280048,0.7082084950091224,-0.35046046065092135,0.47500223263677277,-1.000631968555197,0.06021048371755151

We are really practicing our strategy.  We are trying to make sure we two strategies that we feel good about, and we are going to be working to be accurate.  And how are we going to be accurate?  We are going to check our work with two different strategies. And if this is the strategy that you’re using, you’re going to make sure that you put the pieces back together.  That’s what over here – and the only thing, Student E, I wish that you would do is this, what I did here.  Show me that you have all your pieces. So just to let you know, we’ve been working in three groups.  I’m gonna put some challenge problems up here.  The challenge people are going to be working on their own, okay?  The challenge is completely voluntary.  You just feel like doing it. But in the challenge group, everybody has to show me the array that represents their numbers, okay?  Because that’s another problem.  People are missing of the problem, of the multiplication problem.  So I’m gonna say – and the group that I’ve been working with, the one at the back table, I’m gonna work with you, and we’re gonna work right up here, all right? So we’re not moving.  We do have to trade places.  Like you two can work at the round table, and you’re gonna have your own problems, all right.  So what I would really like you to do – and everybody needs their math notebook.  We’re actually not gonna need this book, today.
